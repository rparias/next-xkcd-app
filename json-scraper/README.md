This script is going to get the json files automatically from 
https://xkcd.com/614/info.0.json

The number 614 is just the number of the comic, you can replace it.

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the index.js:

```bash
node index.js
```

Open the comics folder to see the json files.
